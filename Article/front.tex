\begin{abstract}
We approach the problem if a blockchain is a secure technology by implementing a blockchain algorithm in Rho-Calculus. To do that we have made some additions to Rho-Calculus and we propose a type system that the blockchain should conform to. We are checking if the integrity of our implementation of a blockchain protocol in rho-calculus, would hold. The idea of making a blockchain in rho-calculus is from the RChain protocol which is current in creation. We would only make the rho-calculus make sure the integrity of a system, there is also other security issues there need to be insured before one can call the implementation in the rho-calculus for secure.
