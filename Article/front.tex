\begin{abstract}
In this article we will try to verify the integrity of a blockchain protocol in the rho-calculus. To do this we chose to implement a blockchain in the rho-calculus. We also chose to extend the rho-calculus to make our blockchain implementation easier to design and read, as it is possible to make an implementation without the extensions but that would be far more complex.\\
To verify the integrity of our blockchain, we present a type system. The type system consists of several types with security levels. The security levels are added to make sure that secure information is inaccessable to insecure environments.\\
The type system is proven to prevent the integrity of a protocol from being broken, if the protocol is given a correct typing. The type system is not limited in usage to our blockchain implementation, but can be applied to any other implementation written in the rho-calculus.\\
We have achieved designing and proving a type system, that can verify the integrity of an implementation written in the rho-calculus.
