\begin{abstract}
We approach the problem if a blockchain is a secure technology by implementing a blockchain algorithm in Rho-Calculus. To do that we have made some extensions to Rho-Calculus and we propose a type system that the blockchain should conform to. We have shown that the rho-calculus is a usable calculus, we managed to implement a blockchain protocol, and make a type system which ensures the integrity of a system. Our type system comes with security levels, so if we can ensure that our type system is not broken, and that the protocol conforms to the type system, we know that nothing with a low security level can access anything with a high security level.
