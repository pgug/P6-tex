\subsection{Equivalence Relations}
The structural congruence of processes is denoted by the relation $\equiv$.

\begin{align*}
	P\para 0 \equiv\ &P \equiv 0\para P\\
    P\para Q &\equiv Q\para P\\
    P\para (Q\para R)&\equiv (P\para Q)\para R
\end{align*}

The equivalence of names is denoted by the relation $\equiv _N$

\begin{align}
	& \infrule{}{\quot{\drop{x}}\equiv _N x} \tag{Drop and Quote}
\end{align}

\noindent
The rule states that if $x$ is dropped, and then quoted, then it should stay name equivalent with $x$.

\begin{align}
	& \infrule{P\equiv Q}{\quot{P} \equiv _N \quot{Q}} \tag{Structural equivalence}
\end{align}

\noindent
The rule states, that if $P$ and $Q$ are structural congruent with each other, then the quoted $P$ and $Q$ are name equivalent with each other.

\subsection{Reduction Rules}
We make use of the following reduction rules.

\subsubsection{Base rules}
These are similar to the reduction rules of the rho-calculus as described in \citep{Meredith2005}. The only difference is the communication rule reflecting the syntax changes.

\begin{align}
	\tag{Comm} \infrule{x_0 \equiv_N x_1}{\lift{x_0}{M}\para\inp{x_1}{y}P\ra P\{M/y\}}&\\
	\tag{Parallel} \infrule{P\ra P'}{P\para Q\ra P'\para Q}&\\
	\tag{Equivalence} \infrule{P\equiv P'\quad P'\ra Q'\quad Q'\equiv Q}{P\ra Q}&
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Rules for conditional processes}
The reduction rule of a given conditional process is decided by its boolean expression. These are evaluated using common boolean arithmetics.

\begin{align}
	& \infrule{\phi \ra \top}{[\phi]P\ra P} \tag{True}\\
	& \infrule{\phi \ra \bot}{[\phi]P\ra \nil} \tag{False}
\end{align}
