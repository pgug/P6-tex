\subsection{Evaluating Terms}
In order to make use of our terms we need to define how to evaluate them.
The operation terms are intended to operate on terms, so it is sufficient to define how to evaluate these operations.
The operations defined in this section are chosen specifically for modeling a blockchain protocol and could be different given another goal.

\subsubsection{Encryption and Decryption}
The operations of encryption and decryption are each others inverse.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{align*}
        &dec(enc(M_1, M_2),M_2) = M_1 \tag{Decrypt}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Operations for encrypting and decrypting a message $M_1\ \mathrm{with\ key}\ M_2$.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{List operations}

The list operations allows the abstraction of lists. They are described as follows:

\begin{description}
	\item[head(list)] The first element of the list
	\item[tail(list)] The list without its first element
	\item[append(x, list)] The list with element $x$ appended to its beginning.
\end{description}

These operations are defined by the rules of \figref{listoprules}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{align*}
		&head(append(M_1, M_2)) = M_1 \tag{Head} \\
		&tail(append(M_1, M_2)) = M_2 \tag{Tail}
	\end{align*}
	\caption{The rules of the list operations}
	\label{listoprules}
\end{figure}
