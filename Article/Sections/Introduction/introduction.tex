\section{Introduction}
Blockchain implementations are very important in modern technology such as bitcoin, since a lot of money is invested in bitcoin and other blockchain based technology's it is important to verify that the blockchain provides the security you will expect of it.\\
\\
We have discussed security related features of a blockchain implementation and which security features could be interesting to analyze based on importance for the blockchain and general interest from the authors.\\
\\
In the article we have developed some extensions to the rho language, the extensions are made so we can implement a blockchain for analysis of security features.\\
\\
We have made a simple implementation of a blockchain, furthermore there is also developed a type-system for the blockchain on top of our rho implantation. These implementations is developed to test wherever the blockchain protocol is safe.
