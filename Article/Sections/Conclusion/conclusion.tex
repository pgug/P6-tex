\section{Future work}
For further work we could implement other security feature in the rho-calculus so instead of only hold the integrity of a system, it could hold its Authenticity or its Immutability, other security features could also be implemented. The rho-calculus could also be implemented into a type checker or model checker, and that way check a model for its integrity or the other security features. But with the work we have done on the rho-calculus we have show that it is useful and can be use in other occasions, because it is as strong and expressive as the pi calculus as shown in \citep{Meredith2005}, but we have shown that we could implement a blockchain protocol in it.



\section{Conclusion}
We have shown that the rho-calculus is a usable calculus, we managed to implement a blockchain protocol, and maked a type system which ensures the integrity of a system.
