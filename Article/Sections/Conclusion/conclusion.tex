\section{Conclusion}
In this article, we have shown that it is possible to verify the integrity of a protocol in the rho-calculus. It was done by extending the rho-calculus to make it easier to model our chosen protocol, and also make the model easier to understand. It was not necessary to extend the rho-calculus as it was already possible to model a blockchain protocol without the extensions, but it would make it far more complex not to and as the rho-calculus in itself, is not the main focus of this article, extending the rho-calculus was chosen.\\
We designed a type system, that can be added on top of a model written in the rho-calculus. The type system adds type rules, to verify that a process is well-typed after a transition. In the article we prove by induction that our type system is valid and therefore also correctly determine if the models integrity is broken on runtime.\\
We verified a part of our blockchain protocol with our type system. The derivation trees showed that our type rules could successfully be used to verify the integrity of a part of the protocol.\\

% further work
For further work we could implement other security features in the rho-calculus such that instead of only verifying the integrity of a model, it could verify its authenticity or its immutability. The type system could also be further implemented into a full type checker or model checker, and in that way check a model for its integrity or for other security features. With the work we have done on the rho-calculus we have shown that it is a expressive calculus capable of expressing complex protocols like the blockchain, and also capable of receiving extensions to simplify the models written in the rho-calculus.
