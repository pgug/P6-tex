\section{Conclusion}
In this article, we have shown that it is possible to implement a simple blockchain protocol in the rho-calculus. It was done by extending the rho-calculus to make it easier to model the protocol, and also make the model easier to understand. It was not necessary to extend the rho-calculus is it was already possible to model our blockchain protocol without the extensions, but it make it far more complex and as the rho-calculus in it self, is no the main focus of this article, extending the rho-calculus was chosen.\\
We designed a type system, that can be added on top of a model written in the rho-calculus. The type system adds type rules, to verify that a process is well-typed after a transition. In the article we prove by induction that our type system is valid and therefore also correctly determine if the models integrity is broken on runtime.\\
We tried verifying a part of our blockchain protocol with our type system. The derivation trees showed that our type rules could successfully be used to verify the correctness of the protocol.\\

% further work
For further work we could implement other security feature in the rho-calculus such that instead of only proving the integrity of a system, it could hold its authenticity or its immutability. The type system could also be further implemented into a full type checker or model checker, and in that way check a model for its integrity or for other security features. But with the work we have done on the rho-calculus we have shown that it is useful and can be use in other occasions, because it is as strong and expressive as the pi calculus as shown in\citep{Meredith2005}, but we have shown that we could implement a blockchain protocol in it.
