\section{Blockchain introduction}
The blockchain is a distributed algorithm mostly known from bitcoin. The protocol/algorithm consists of a chain of blocks, hence the name, where every node in the network can add new blocks to the chain. To ensure that the blocks are valid consensus has to be achieved. This is done with a consensus protocol/algorithm. Depending on the protocol/algorithm the process is different, but a common property is that over 50\% of the network has to agree that the block is valid.\\
Because the protocol/algorithm is distributed there are several security risk. As an important aspect of the protocol/algorithm is that blocks integrity are never breached, as such designing a solution for solving integrity problems would be very interesting/relevant. Therefor solving this problem will be the focus of this article.
