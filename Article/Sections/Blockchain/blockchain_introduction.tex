\section{Blockchain introduction}
The blockchain is a distributed algorithm (protocol) mostly known from bitcoin. The protocol consists of a chain of blocks, hence the name, where anyone in the network can add new blocks to the chain. To ensure that the blocks are valid consensus has to be achieved. This is done with a consensus protocol and depending on the protocol the process is different, but a common property is that the network will eventually agree on the same chain.\\
Because the protocol is distributed there are several security risks. An important aspect of the protocol is that the chains integrity is never breached, as such designing a solution for solving those integrity problems would be very relevant. Solving these problems will be the focus of this article.
