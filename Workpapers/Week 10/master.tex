\section{Workpaper week 10}
The notation of the $\rho$-Calculus.\citep{Meredith2005}\\
P,Q ::= \nil \ Nil\\
|\inp{x}{y}P Input\\
|\lift{x}{P} Lift\\
|\drop{x} Drop\\
|P\para Q Parallel\\
x,y::= \quot{P} Quot\\


\subsection{Numbers}
This example could be a way of expressing numbers in $\rho$ - Calculus. Where the number takes place as $x$ or $y$ in the notation. By quoting the last number you get a higher number, and by droping a number you get a lower number, and at 0 you get the process P.\\
$0:$ \quot{\nil}\\
$1:$ \quot{\lift{\quot{\nil}}{\nil}}\\
$2:$ \quot{\lift{\quot{\nil}}{\lift{\quot{\nil}}{\nil}}}\\
$3:$ \quot{\lift{\quot{\nil}}{\lift{\quot{\nil}}{\lift{\quot{\nil}}{\nil}}}}\\
$4:$ \quot{\lift{\quot{\nil}}{\lift{\quot{\nil}}{\lift{\quot{\nil}}{\lift{\quot{\nil}}{\nil}}}}}\\

\subsection{Structure}
We can express some of the programming terms in $\rho$-Calculus, but more has to be discovered.\\
$if\ a == b\ then\ P$ Can be express in $\rho$-Calculus as: \lift{a}{\nil} \para \inp{b}{x}P
\\ We send \nil \ on channel $a$ and if channel $a$ and channel $b$ is equal then channel $b$ will get a  \nil \ and execute $P$.
%$[P,Q]:$ \lift{x}{\drop{P \para Q}} \para \inp{x}{y}\quot{y}
\\\\
$P+Q$ Can be express in $\rho$-Calculus as: \lift{a}{0} \para \inp{a}{x}P \para \inp{a}{x}Q
\\We can make a determanistic choice between $P$ and $Q$ by sending \nil \ on channel $a$ and in parralel two channel $a$ tryies both to recive, but only one would succed and would run its procces $P$ or procces $Q$.

\subsection{Yet to be solved}
We need to express more programming structures, before we can use the $\rho$-Calculs to model a blockchain structure or even r-chain. These are a few exampels of what we need to express, and more should follow.
\begin{itemize}
\item if a$\neq$ b then P
\item if a<b then P
\item if a>b then P
\item if a==b then P else Q
\end{itemize}
