\subsubsection{Encryption and Decryption}
The operation of encryption and decryption is each others inverse.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{align*}
        &dec(enc(M_1, M_2),M_2) = M_1 \tag{Decrypt}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Operations for encrypting and decrypting a message $M_1\ \mathrm{with\ key}\ M_2$.}

\subsubsection{List operations}

The list operations allows the abstraction of lists. They are described as follows:

\begin{description}
	\item[head(list)] The first element of the list
	\item[tail(list)] The list without its first element
	\item[append(x, list)] The list with element \textit{x} appended to its beginning.
\end{description}

These operations are defined by the rules of \figref{listoprules}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{align*}
		&head(append(M_1, M_2)) = M_1 \tag{Head} \\
		&tail(append(M_1, M_2)) = M_2 \tag{Tail}
	\end{align*}
	\caption{The rules of the list operations}
