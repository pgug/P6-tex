\subsubsection{Tuple operation}
The operation for getting terms out of a tuple could look like this projection, where \textit{k} determines the index starting from 1.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{align*}
        \pi^k((M_1,..., M_n))=M_k \text{ If } 1\leq k \leq n
    \end{align*}
    \caption{The operation for indexing a tuple. Where \textit{M} is a tuple, and \textit{k} is the index and bigger than  or equal to 1}
