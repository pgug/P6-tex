\begin{align*}
P  ::= \; &  \nil & \text{nil} \\
  & \mid \inp{x}{y}P & \text{input} \\
  & \mid \lift{x}{M} & \text{lift} \\
  & \mid \drop{x} & \text{drop} \\
  & \mid P \para Q & \text{parallel} \\[3mm]
x,y ::= \; & \quot{P} & \text{quote}\\\end{align*}
Rho-Calculus is developed and described by L. G. Meredith and M. Radestock in \citep{Meredith2005}. We are building upon their work, to make a calculus strong enough to handle a block chain protocol.

\begin{align*}
M::=\; & n \mid s \mid (M_1,...,M_k) \mid fM &for\ all\ k \geq 2
\end{align*}
Our additional syntax rule, where $M$ is terms, $n$ is numbers, $s$ is strings and $f$ is a operation.
